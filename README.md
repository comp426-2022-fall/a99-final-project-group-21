# a99 Final Project 
 
## Calorie Tracker

Final Project For Group 21

## Summary 
Group 21 will create a tool for users to track daily calories through the availablity of inputing of calories within the interface. Upon the user creating an account, the calorie tracker will ask for current weight then goal weight and will create a algorithmic estimate of caloric range. The user is able to check with this number and input meals eaten to see if it is matching said number.

*Disclaimer: This tool will not take into account macros as the group has no background in nutrition and would like to provide a simple interface for recommended caloric intake with ability to track.

## First Steps
1. Choose a license and update the LICENSE file accordingly. 
2. Create and Edit the README.md file and use it as the main location of your technical documentation with links out to information contained under `/docs/`.
3. Create a `/docs/` directory for more elaborate documentation of your API, planning notes, etc.
4. Make sure that all of the team members have access to the repository as administrators.
5. Create a project under the **Projects** tab. Use this to manage your planning. Create a To-do list, etc. Explore the tools available and user them to manage your project.
6. Assign team roles and include a listing of those roles in this README.md file or in another file under `/docs/`.
7. Then put your entire development workflow in this repository.
8. Use **Pull requests** to propose changes and incorporate them into your code from various team members. 
9. Use **Issues** to identify and track bugs and also to communicate about various aspects of the project.
